# Project Todos

This is a todo-list project made with Redux, React, JSX and CSS. 
In this app you can add tasks, check them off and delete them. It is made with a mobile first approach and design with a clean look. 

## The problem

The biggest issue during this project was understanding how the Redux works together with React to dispatch and get information between the store and the app. It was a very fun project to do and I really liked the creative freedom it gave us.
